🔧 Using Maltego — Exploring the Transforms
Maltego operates through transforms, which are plugins that extract, manipulate, and visualize data. Let’s take a guided tour of the transforms and gather information from our target website: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/.

1. Domain To IP — This transform reveals the IP address associated with a domain. Enter the target domain and witness the magic unfold.

2. Affiliation Transform — This transform seeks to uncover connections between domains. It can reveal domains linked to the initial target, potentially exposing interconnected websites.

3. DNS Enum Transform — By executing this transform, you can enumerate DNS information related to the target domain, such as subdomains.

4. Email Address To Person — This intriguing transform attempts to identify the person behind an email address. It may reveal connections to social media profiles or other online identities.

5. Website Links — A simple yet powerful transform, it extracts links present on the target website. This can lead to discovering additional web assets.

6. Website Links (Graphical) — Visualize the links on the target website in a graph format. This provides a clear view of the relationships between different pages.

💡 Practical Exercise: Exploring http://testphp.vulnweb.com/
Let’s put Maltego to the test. Input the target URL and apply the transforms we’ve discussed. Observe how each transform uncovers a layer of information, gradually building a comprehensive understanding of the website’s connections and vulnerabilities
